It is primarily involved in intracellular signaling pathways and may play a role in regulating cellular processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis.
HLA-DMB####HLA-DMB, or major histocompatibility complex, class II, DM beta, is a human gene that encodes a protein involved in the immune system. It plays a crucial role in the antigen presentation process, by aiding in the loading of antigenic peptides onto major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules, which are then recognized by T cells, facilitating immune responses.
AP5Z1####Gene AP5Z1, also known as Adaptor-related protein complex 5 subunit zeta 1, is a gene that encodes a protein that is a subunit of the adaptor protein complex AP-5, which is involved in vesicle-mediated transport processes within the cell.
C4orf48####Gene C4orf48 is a protein-coding gene located on chromosome 4, specifically within an open reading frame (ORF) on the forward strand, but its specific function and characteristics are not well-defined in current scientific literature.
ABHD14A####Gene ABHD14A, also known as abhydrolase domain-containing protein 14A, encodes an enzyme that belongs to the ABHD family and is involved in lipid metabolism.
AP5B1####AP5B1 (Adaptor Related Protein Complex 5 Subunit Beta 1) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in vesicular transport processes, specifically related to the function of the adaptor protein complex AP-5, which plays a role in protein sorting and trafficking within cells.
BRK1####The BRK1 gene encodes a component of the WAVE regulatory complex, which is involved in the regulation of actin cytoskeleton dynamics and is essential for various cellular processes such as cell migration, morphology, and signaling.
GATC####Gene GATC does not refer to a specific gene. Instead, "GATC" represents a sequence of nucleotides (guanine, adenine, thymine, cytosine) in DNA. This sequence can be part of various genes in different organisms and plays a role in the genetic code that dictates the synthesis of proteins.
INAFM1####The gene INAFM1 is responsible for encoding a protein that is involved in various cellular processes. It may play a role in cell signaling, regulation of gene expression, or other important biological functions. Further research is needed to fully understand the specific role and function of the INAFM1 gene in the body.
CUX1####Gene CUX1, also known as Cut-like homeobox 1, is a gene that encodes a transcription factor protein involved in regulating cell growth, differentiation, and development in organisms. It is known to play a role in various cellular processes including cell cycle progression, apoptosis, and DNA repair. Mutations in CUX1 have been associated with certain cancers and developmental disorders.
SCX####The SCX gene, also known as spinal cord homeobox, is a gene that encodes a transcription factor involved in the development of the spinal cord and the central nervous system. This gene plays a key role in the specification and differentiation of neuronal cells during embryonic development.
CORO7####CORO7, also known as coronin 7, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the coronin family of actin-binding proteins. It is involved in various cellular processes, including cytoskeletal organization, intracellular trafficking, and regulation of cell division.
KMT2B####KMT2B (Lysine Methyltransferase 2B) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of gene expression by modifying the chromatin structure, specifically by methylating the lysine 4 position of histone H3. This modification plays a key role in developmental processes and has been implicated in various neurological disorders.
